# Rust development environment setup

_Rust Bootcamp week 1: Setting up your development environment_

This week, you will learn how to optimize your Rust development workflow using powerful tools such as programming suggestions, prompts with Copilot, and GitHub Codespaces. By diving into the lessons on programming with suggestions, using prompts with Copilot, and exploring the fundamentals of Codespaces, you will acquire the skills to streamline your coding process and collaborate more efficiently with others.

This is the first week of the Rust Bootcamp. There are 4 weeks in total:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-fundamentals) 
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-structs-types-enums/)
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/applied-rust)

## Contents
This week has several references to supporting content that can help you setup your environment.. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.

:fire: If you need a quick reference for Codespaces and configuration with Visual Studio Code, feel free to reuse the [configuration files](./.devcontainer) in this repository.
